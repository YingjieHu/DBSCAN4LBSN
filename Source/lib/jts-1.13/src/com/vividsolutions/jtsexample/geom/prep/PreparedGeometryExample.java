/**
 * Shows use of {@link PreparedGeometry} in a batch (repeated) operation.
 * 
 * The example uses a Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of Pi.
 * Given a circle inscribed in a square and a large number of random points
 * in the square, the number of points which intersect the circle approximates Pi/4.  
 * This involves repeated Point-In-Polygon tests, which is one of the 
 * geometry tests optimized by the PreparedGeometry implementation for polygons.
 *
