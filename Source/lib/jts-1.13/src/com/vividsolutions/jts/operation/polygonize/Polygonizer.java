/**
 * Polygonizes a set of {@link Geometry}s which contain linework that
 * represents the edges of a planar graph.
 * All types of Geometry are accepted as input;  
 * the constituent linework is extracted as the edges to be polygonized.
 * The processed edges must be correctly noded; that is, they must only meet
 * at their endpoints.  The Polygonizer will run on incorrectly noded input
 * but will not form polygons from non-noded edges, 
 * and will report them as errors.
 * <p>
 * The Polygonizer reports the follow kinds of errors:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Dangles</b> - edges which have one or both ends which are not incident on another edge endpoint
 * <li><b>Cut Edges</b> - edges which are connected at both ends but which do not form part of polygon
 * <li><b>Invalid Ring Lines</b> - edges which form rings which are invalid
 * (e.g. the component lines contain a self-intersection)
 * </ul>
