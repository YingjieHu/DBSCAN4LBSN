/**
 * Simplifies a geometry and ensures that
 * the result is a valid geometry having the
 * same dimension and number of components as the input,
 * and with the components having the same topological 
 * relationship.
 * <p>
 * If the input is a polygonal geometry
 * ( {@link Polygon} or {@link MultiPolygon} ):
 * <ul>
 * <li>The result has the same number of shells and holes as the input,
 * with the same topological structure
 * <li>The result rings touch at <b>no more</b> than the number of touching points in the input
 * (although they may touch at fewer points).  
 * The key implication of this statement is that if the 
 * input is topologically valid, so is the simplified output. 
 * </ul>
 * For linear geometries, if the input does not contain
 * any intersecting line segments, this property
 * will be preserved in the output.
 * <p>
 * For all geometry types, the result will contain 
 * enough vertices to ensure validity.  For polygons
 * and closed linear geometries, the result will have at
 * least 4 vertices; for open linestrings the result
 * will have at least 2 vertices.
 * <p>
 * All geometry types are handled. 
 * Empty and point geometries are returned unchanged.
 * <p>
 * The simplification uses a maximum-distance difference algorithm
 * similar to the Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
 *
 * <h3>KNOWN BUGS</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a small hole is very near an edge, it is possible for the edge to be moved by
 * a relatively large tolerance value and end up with the hole outside the result shell.
 * Similarly, it is possible for a small polygon component to end up inside
 * a nearby larger polygon.
 * A workaround is to test for this situation in post-processing and remove
 * any invalid holes or polygons.
 * </ul>
